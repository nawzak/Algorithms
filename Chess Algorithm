Here’s the board upon which the game takes place.
Here’s your army, where, your opponent has a mirror copy of it on the other end of the board.
Here are the possible movements for each member of both armies.
Each army makes one movement at a time followed by a movement from the other army.
Each movement will result in either the loss of one member of either armies or would result in no casualties.
Your target is to make the necessary movements to take the queen of your opponent before he takes yours.
